		<p style="text-align: justify;">Men and women have different sexual energies â€“ and too often this leads to disharmony, preventing us from fully exploring our sexual potential. By harnessing the power of an ancient tradition of sexual wisdom you and your partner can learn to use physical and psychological techniques to experience the bliss of a whole body sexual experience with orgasm after orgasm. <br><br>The unique "Sexercises" presented can help anyone go deeper into a loving relationship. The art that has evolved over centuries of Taoist understanding can be brought to life again today to further expand the healing power for lovers. <br><br>Couples will find and increase their sexual energy potential, and deepen their physical compatibility, as well as develop an ecstatic form of acupressure. Sexuality taught as a way for health and healing, spiritual growth and longevity.</p> 	</div>
