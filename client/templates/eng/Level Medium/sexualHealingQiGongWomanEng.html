		<p style="text-align: justify;">Women lose little sexual energy through orgasm, but instead lose it primarily through menstruation and childbearing. The sexual guidance and exercises presented are being introduced plainly to the Western public for the first time. <br><br>For thousands of years Taoist masters taught these secrets only to very small numbers of people in the royal courts and in esoteric circles, who were sworn to silence. These are the 3 main practices that women can use to cultivate and enhance their sexual energy: the Ovarian Breathing, Breast Massage and the Orgasmic Upward Draw. When this practice is mastered one can experience a total body orgasm that is beyond ordinary vaginal orgasm without losing life-force energy. <br><br>A series of exercises with a jade or stone egg is used to strengthen the urogenital and pelvic diaphragm, the muscles of the vagina and the glands, tendons and nervous system. The practice can shorten menstruation, reduce cramps and compress more life force energy (Chi) into the ovaries for more sexual and creative power.</p> 	</div>
