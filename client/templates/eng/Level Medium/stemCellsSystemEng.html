		<p style="text-align: justify;">Stem cells are neutral cells that can change themselves into different tissue types where need it. <br><br>The purification of stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood, allows scientists to research the function of the immune system and to develop treatments for diseases such AIDS and leukemia.<br><br>Stem cells can be found in adult human beings. Adult stem cells reproduce daily to provide certain specialized cells - for example 200 billion red blood cells are created each day in the body. Until recently it was thought that each of these cells could produce just one particular type of cell - this is called differentiation however in the past few years, evidence has been gathered of stem cells that can transform into several different forms. Bone marrow stem cells are known to be able to transform into liver, nerve, muscle and kidney cells. <br><br>Useful sources of adult stem cells are being found in organs all over the body. Researchers have extracted stem cells from skin that are able to differentiate into many types of tissue, including neurons, smooth muscle cells and fat-cells. In this special technique we stimulate the body to keep producing the stem cells by drawing the Qi in our body and hitting the body and the internal organs.</p> 	</div>
