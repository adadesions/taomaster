		<p style="text-align: justify;">The Microcosmic Orbit is the foundation of all the Healing Qi Gong practices.<br><br>Each new practice is dependent upon the high quality of your meditations and your ability to perfect the Microcosmic Orbit. <br><br>The Microcosmic Orbit Meditation awakens, circulates and directs Chi through the “Governator Channel”, which ascends from the base of the spine up to the head and the “Functional Channel”, which runs from the tip of the tongue down the middle of the torso to the perineum.<br><br>The meditations of the Microcosmic Orbit strengthen the 'Original Chi' and teach you the basics of circulating Chi. They allow the palms, the soles of the feet, the mideyebrow point and the crown to open. These specific locations are the major points there energy can be absorbed, condensed and transformed into fresh new life force.<br><br>Dedicated practice of this ancient esoteric method eliminates stress and nervous tension, energize the internal organs, restores health to damaged tissue and builds a strong sense of personal well-being.</p>
